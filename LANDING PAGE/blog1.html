  <p>When you are a kid are you looking at websites and wonder how they made? How do they made design eye-catching on a screen? Because this questions plays in my mind and sparked my curiosity in digital world. When i was a kid, i make time for browsing and looking for different websites checking for web-design especially game websites. Now as i grew older and an IT student, my curiosity bloomed into a passion. What was once i curious became something i want to learn and explore because i want to fulfill my curiosity when i was a kid. This blog is where i share my story how i started just because of curiosity and how HTML became my first love and how HTML became my first love.

  <h2>How it started </h2>
  <hr width="100%" size="5" color="#D4AF37"> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> One day, when i am searching for a game websites i was curious on how these websites made? and how they were design. I remember the game website that catches my eye is the <strong>"Friv"</strong> because of it's color the one i favorite a shade of violet and a unique design unlike in the other game website i explored. Then i search about on what are the basics of website coding, then that is when i first saw the HTML. At first look, it amazed me and answers my question on my mind that this is how websites are made and i started to learn some basic html coding. I watch youtube videos and research, it made me feel fun and enjoying that time. When the time goes by, during my senior high school year. We had a subject that is related to web-designing a empowerment technology where we explore html basics and how coding works. It flashes back my memories in my childhood, the little girl who's curious on how website's are made is now making it possible we had a website project. Our website is titled "Star Gazing" it is about exploring planets where in we made logo's from scratch, researching for contents, web-desingning and etc. While making that project i was happy and able to collaborate with my groupmates i shared some of my knowledge to them and we applied it in our website. It tooks us 1-2 weeks to finish the entire website, it was tired but i felt happy and fulfillment. After finishing, the presentation day began since we are in an online distance learning set-up that time. We present thru video call in google meet. Our professor required us to wear a formal attire and set a background into the theme of our website. During presentation i was nervous, because it was my first time to present in an online set-up but it ended up successful and we got a grade of 100 for our website. When i heared that our professor chose us a group as one of the best web-design in senior high school i was very happy and grateful and that recognition made me feel proud of myself. In my college life right now, i have a subject integrative programming 1 and the programming language is HTML5 i felt excited because i will learned and explore new things. I admit that i still have difficulty in some areas but i am willing and eager to learned. I will continue and expand my learning even though in some topics i forgot already in my previous study during SHS.</p>

  <hr width="100%" size="5" color="#D4AF37"> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Looking back, my journet with HTML began with simple childhood curiosity and grew into a passopn that continues to shape who i am today. What started as wondering websites were created slowey turn into learning, creatomg, and beliweing in my own abilities. From exploring game websites to building my first project in my shs journey, every experienced strengthend my interest in web design and programming. HTML became more than a programming language it became the foundation of my growth, creativity, and confidence in a digital world. As I continue my journey as an IT student, i carry with me the same curiosity that it all started, now guided by knowledge, experience and determination to keep learning and keep reminds my self that there is an always a room for improvement. </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
